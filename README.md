# MPG-Dataset-Analysis
## Data Understanding
- The dataset has 9 columns, with a size of 398 rows
- 7 numeric columns, 2 categorical columns
  
Variables Description :
- MPG: mileage per gallon
- cylinders: number of cylinders
- displacement: piston stroke volume
- horsepower: engine power produced
- weight: the weight of the car
- acceleration: acceleration time from 0 to 60 km
- model_year : year of manufacture
- origin: the origin of the car
- name : car name
## Missing Value
1. There are missing values ​​in the horsepower column.
2. Check for outliers in the horsepower column to determine the next stage
3. There are outlier values ​​in the horsepower column, therefore we will impute medium value rather than mean value
